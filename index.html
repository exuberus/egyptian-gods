        <h1>Egyptian Gods</h1>
        <p>The Egyptian Gods are deities that are part of Ancient Egyptian mythology. These deities, omnipresent and metamorphic, influenced the elements and controlled nature.</p>
        <p>The best known cult was that of Isis and Osiris. The Egyptians believed that they populated all of Egypt and instructed the peasants in the techniques of agriculture.</p>

        <h2>Religion in Ancient Egypt</h2>
        <p>In Ancient Egypt, religion was polytheistic, that is, several gods were worshiped. These deities had varied roles and characteristics, and were worshiped in Egypt and elsewhere, including in Europe.</p>
        <p>The Egyptian gods have much in common with men: they can be born, grow old, and die, besides having a name, feelings, and a body that must be fed.</p>
        <p>However, these human aspects hide an exceptional nature: their bodies, made of precious materials, are endowed with a power of transformation, and their tears can originate other beings or minerals.</p>
        <p>There are aspects of these gods in various combinations: fully human, fully animal, with the body of a man and the head of an animal, with the entire animal in place of the head (the scarab, for example) or with a human head.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that there were wars between Egyptian cities that had rival gods.</p>
